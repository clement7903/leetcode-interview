#### What is dynamic programming?

- Breaking down the bigger problem and solving it using results from the subproblems to solve the bigger problem. Often it includes storing the results of the subproblems.
- It could be done using iterative / recursion methods

#### When is dynamic programming used?

- Optimization problems (limited resources / capacity constraint + need to get the best outcome)
- When

#### Examples of problems solved using dynamic programming

- Knapsack (weight constraint + profit maximisation)
